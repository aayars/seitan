Dry Mix
- 1/2 cup vital wheat gluten
- 1/3 cup instant mashed potato flakes
- 1.5 tsp brown sugar
- ~.5 tsp each:
    - amchur
    - coriander
    - black garlic
    - paprika
    - beet root powder
    - smoked salt
    - black pepper
- dash of celery salt
- 1 tsp shiitake powder

Wet Mix
- 1/3 cup water
- 1.5 Tbsp vinegar (eg. apple cider, rice, red wine; any of these are fine)
- 1 tsp lime juice
- 1 tsp Better Than Bouillon - Not Beef
- 1 tsp Tomato Paste
- ~8 drops Maggi seasoning
- Maggi veg bouillon cube

Simmer Sauce
- 1 tsp each:
    - Molasses
    - Shiitake powder
    - Onion powder
    - Better Than Bouillon - Not Beef
    - Olive oil
- .5 tsp red wine vinegar
- .5 tsp lime juice
- Enough water to almost cover filet

Add dry ingredients to bowl. Mix wet ingredients separately. Work wet mix into dry mix. Dough is intentionally dry. After preliminary mixing, if there is still powdered dry mix in the bowl, add only just enough water so that there's no more powder left stuck to the bowl, 1 tsp at a time. When the wet mix is worked in, start to develop the strong directional gluten strands: Knead, knead, knead some more, roll into log, braid, tie into knots, flatten and massage into filets (this is a labor intensive process). Coat filets with olive oil and sauté each side. Simmer each side in simmer sauce for 30m (total 1h). Keep water just below boiling point. Don't let simmer sauce turn into sludge, keep adding water as needed. Remove from simmer sauce and transfer to fridge for 4 hours or until cool. Save simmer sauce for future attempts. To serve, hand-shred and sauté the shreds for about 4-5 minutes.
